# Python_Project_Instacart

## Introduction

This is a fictive project where the data analyst should provide insights based on sales pattern for the stakeholders of Instacart. Instarcart is an online grocery store available as an app.

### Key questions worked on the scripts

● What are the busiest days of the week and hours of the day (i.e., the days and times with the most orders)? In order to schedule ads at
times when there are fewer orders.

● Is there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money? This might inform the type of products to be advertised at these times.

● Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.

● Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product orders.
